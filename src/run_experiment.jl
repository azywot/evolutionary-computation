# REAL EXAMPLE - TSPA
# NOTE: sth's wrong with delta calculation 
# - I am wondering whether its's because of selecting half of the solution and possibly 
# some mess in the inter route move, especially indices, modulo 
# - I left the comments I found useful along the way - maybe they would come handy too,
# otherwise feel free to delete them ü´°üëç
# - I suggest commenting out parts in local_steepest to investigate the routes separately, with different modes etc.
# - Will look at this one back in a few days üôè
# - you can delete this comment too, I just wanted to leave some notes haha
